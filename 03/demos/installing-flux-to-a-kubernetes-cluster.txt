This exercise assumes a working Kubernetes cluster. This could be a cluster
running on a public cloud platform (e.g. EKS, GKS, AKS, DKS), or it could be a
local cluster (e.g. Minikube, Docker Desktop , kind, k3d). The demo in the
course uses k3d.

The kubectl (https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) command
line tool is required, as is an account on a git hosting provider, such as;
GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket Server, AWS CodeCommit, or Azure DevOps. The lab uses
the Flux CLI, which can be installed according to the following instructions:
https://fluxcd.io/docs/installation/#install-the-flux-cli.


Exercise: INSTALLING FLUX TO A KUBERNETES CLUSTER
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Explore the Flux CLI and all of its sub-commands in order to get a feel for
   what it can do for you.

flux --help

2. Check that your Kubernetes environment is suitable for Flux by checking the
   prerequisites.

flux check --pre

3. Create a personal access token for your git host provider, with permissions
   that allow for creating and writing to repositories. Check the relevant Flux
   documentation for bootstrapping to cloud provider git hosting solutions:
   https://fluxcd.io/docs/use-cases/.

4. If using a personal access token, make it available in the environment (e.g.
   GITHUB_TOKEN, GITLAB_TOKEN, BITBUCKET_TOKEN)

export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXE

5. Use the Flux CLI to bootstrap Flux.

flux bootstrap github \
  --repository gitops-lab-flux \
  --owner <user> \
  --personal true \
  --components-extra=image-reflector-controller,image-automation-controller

6. Check that the GitOps Toolkit components have started up correctly in the
   cluster. There should be a pod running for each of the toolkit components.

kubectl -n flux-system get all

7. Navigate to the repository in your git host provider, to verify that Flux
   has created it as expected. Examine the contents of the 'flux-system'
   folder. Notice that there are component installation manifests, as well as
   'sync' manifests.

If all has gone well, you should have a working Flux installation, comprised of
the GitOps Toolkit controllers!
